# `git` — how do I...?

 * TODO: workshop!
 * ...figure out what's going on?
 * ...rebase my GitHub pull request?
 * ...ressurect my repository?
 * ...squash/split commits?

???

Prizes!

 1. Prepare a cluster-fuck repository, ask what they see?
 2. Use a real example.
 3. Use the borked repo, ask how to fix?
 4. Use the real example.

# `<code>`

 * Your role?

???

---

# English

 * I strongly advise you to learn English.
 * I advise you to *speak* English.

???

 * Watch TV series in English (English subs if needed).
 * Read English content.
 * Write in English.
 * Play games in English.
 * Set language on your devices to English.

---

# YOU!

* It's not just about the code, it's about you!
* Speak at conferences, meetups, school classes.
* Get involved in the community.
* Start a technical blog.
* Experience is everything.
* Social networks are powerful.

???

* E.g. to get a senior promote, the technical expertise is probably the less signifficant
  * And probably the promotion committee doesn't care about your code.
  * But coding is required to get the right skills, though.
* Being a good dev is not just about writing code, it's about presenting yourself.
* No one will call you a good dev if you are working on bullshit or no one knows about you.
* Be the face of your school project. Lead the project.
* Not just about writing code, also review PRs, respond to issues, help with testing, ...
* Deploy the blog first! Write about your experience.
* Theory in school vs. practical in a real job. Tell own experience.
  * What's valuable from school? Security, linux/unix/windows labs, math, algorithms, project management.
* Twitter is good.
